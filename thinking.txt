Okay, I understand the request. This requires historical astronomical data.

1.  **ANALYSIS:** The task is to find the dates of the first two lunar eclipses that occurred after the year 1 AD. This information isn't typically stored locally and requires accessing external knowledge.
2.  **SELECT Tool:** The most appropriate tool is `<mcp__web_search>` to find this historical astronomical information.
3.  **REQUEST:**

    ```tool_code
    <mcp__web_search>
        <query>first two lunar eclipses after 1 AD dates</query>
    </mcp__web_search>
    ```
