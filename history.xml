  <task>---This is your task---
speculate on the age of the sun
</task>
  <observations>Okay, I understand the task is "butter a bread". This seems like a metaphorical request, as my tools are designed for software development and interacting with digital environments, not physical actions.

To proceed, I need clarification on how you'd like me to interpret this task using the available tools. For example, should I:
1.  Create a file named `buttered_bread.txt`?
2.  Write a short script or text describing the process?
3.  Search the web for instructions on how to butter bread?

Could you please specify how you'd like me to approach this?

&lt;ask_followup_question&gt;How should I interpret the task "butter a bread" using my available software development tools?&lt;/ask_followup_question&gt;
</observations>
  <thinking>Okay, I need to find the age of the sun. This is a scientific fact, so a web search is the best way to get the current accepted value.

```tool_code
&lt;mcp__web_search&gt;
  &lt;query&gt;age of the sun&lt;/query&gt;
&lt;/mcp__web_search&gt;
```
