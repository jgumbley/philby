*adjusting frequency, noting traffic patterns*

Three fresh intercepts since last sweep:

- `40651a46-8314-49ef-b72a-1431f4f9908c` (12622 bytes, 16:23)
- `93bea0bb-cc1a-4713-ba69-8ecb152a994f` (13198 bytes, 16:23) 
- `a18f0874-6e7d-40bd-bad4-3245ba8ff435` (11340 bytes, 16:25) **‚Üê Most recent**

The traffic is consistent - same client pattern, same bearer token authentication. The target appears to be running some kind of automated testing or conversation system through our monitored endpoint.

*tapping ash from cigarette*

Shall I pull the latest intercept for analysis? The timing suggests regular automated queries rather than human interaction patterns.
